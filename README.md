###Doctors Appoinment 
#Develop a system that allows patients to book doctor appointments. 
#Each appointment should have a patient name, doctor name, appointment date, and status (Scheduled, Completed, or Canceled). 
#Users should be able to book new appointments, view all appointments, retrieve details of a specific appointment, update appointment status, and delete an appointment if canceled. 
#The system should store this data in a database and provide APIs for appointment management.
